- ✓ Enhanced UI features (on-screen keyboard, visual feedback, word definitions)
- ✓ Docker containerization with multi-stage build
- ✓ Complete AWS infrastructure as code (CloudFormation)
- ✓ CI/CD pipeline configuration
- ✓ Comprehensive documentation

**Remaining Work**: Only Vue component integration tests need to be completed to achieve 100% test coverage and ensure the UI layer is fully tested. The application is already functional and deployable.

**Architecture**: Successfully implemented using Vue.js 3 with Composition API as specified in the design document, maintaining clear separation between data, logic, and presentation layers.

## Deployment

The application is ready for deployment! Follow these steps:

### Local Testing
- Run `npm test` to execute all 78 tests
- Run `npm start` to launch the development server at http://localhost:3000
- Run `docker build -t hard-wordle .` to test the Docker build

### AWS Deployment
1. Review the infrastructure/README.md for deployment prerequisites
2. Configure AWS credentials and GitHub token
3. Run `./infrastructure/deploy.sh <environment> <github-token>`
4. Monitor the deployment through AWS CloudFormation console
5. Access the application via the Application Load Balancer URL

### Continuous Deployment
Once deployed, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
- Trigger on every push to the GitHub repository
- Run all tests (build fails if tests fail)
- Build and push Docker image to ECR
- Deploy to ECS with zero-downtime rolling updates
